# Grammatical-Error-Correction using Neural Networks

Course Project by  Yokila Arora, Ayush Gupta, Jaspreet Kaur for CS229 (Autumn 2017)

File description:
1. utils.py: 
  This file contains utility functions for preprocessing the data for Neural Network model, specifically it returns bag of words representations for the training and test datasets. It also contains a method to save the model parameters. 
  
2. train.py: 
  This file contains the Neural Network architecture implemented in PyTorch. 
  
3. maintest.py: 
  This file contains the code for traning and testing the model, along with the hyper-parameters used, and the code for calculation for F0.5 score.
